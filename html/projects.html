                                Downloading and running apache on a Raspberry Pi is more easy than I thought it would be. There was a little bit of hassle when it came to changing the configuration to point to a git repo folder rather than the example index.html, but after that it's

                        <div class='content'>
                            The project included substring-matching search of both users and collections in our database, but due to the limitation of the Marvel Comics API we were using, we could only enable searching comics character by character. E.g. searching 'Spider Man' would
                            not yield the reselt 'The Amazing Spider Man.'
                        </div>

                        Accounts
                        <div class='content'>
                            The site enabled the user to register and log into accounts. Registered users could create collections, add friends, and comment. In addition, a user could change their username which was both used to log in and shown as their name, as well as set the
                            description that others would see when navigating to their user page. Unregistered users could look through public collections and little else.

                        Collections
                        <div class='content'>
                            A registered user could create a collection of any name and privacy, and once created, could search through our catalogue of Marvel comics and add any of their choosing. Private collections could only be seen by a user's friends

                        Friends
                        <div class='content'>
                            Our site implemented a friend request system. To add a friend, you could search for them using the users search, click on their profile, and send them a request. When the user next logged in and viewed their profile, they would see incoming and outgoing
                            friend request, with the option to either accept or deny your request. Upon either choice, you would be sent a message saying what they had chosen, and if they accepted, you would then be friends and could view each others'
                            private collections.

                            Any logged-in user could view a collection and leave comments of limited length with their name.

                    What I Learned
                    <div class='content'>
                        Organization
                        <div class='content'>
                            We as a team had a two-week deadline to adhere to, and naturally had to be very organised. We made a Trello board of To-do/Doing/Done and assigned roles that seemed roughly equal in difficulty. Working in this way made it easier than previously experienced
                            because eeach team member's responsibilites and expectations were established from day one.
                        </div>
                        Collaberation
                        <div class='content'>
                            I was designated the role of back-end programmer. I set up the Java server and core functionality of the website while one member set up the database and the remaining two worked on the Vue.js site. Once completing my part, I and the database member went
                            on to aid in the Vue.js. I often involve myself with too many things, and had to trust that my team members had a handle on their jobs so I could focus on my own.
                        </div>
                        Time management
                        <div class='content'>
                            On the first day, my group mates and I marathoned a 10-hour work day in order to kickstart the project. When we were half way into the allotted time, we realized this time commitment was necessary from the start, and had we not started strong, we would
                            not have finished by the deadline. Overall, there could have been improvement, as I consistently worked 12 hour days to finish the site in time.
                        </div>
                        Communication
                        <div class='content'>
                            To ensure that we were collaberating effectively, we set up a Discord server, similar to a slack group, to call every day and quickly notify each other of issues. I realized it was very helpful to allot a time every day to organize our thoughts so far
                            and share what needed to be done.
