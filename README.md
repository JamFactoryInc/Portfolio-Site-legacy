# Portfolio Site
I'm using this as both the place to showcase my projects and as a project itself.
It only uses vanilla html/css/js to show that I can, although I recognize that there are things like JQuery,
bootstrap, vue.js, etc that would improve productivity.

This website's domain is http://www.jamfactory.tech/ and is hosted on a raspberry pi running apache2
